# Use this file to create levels for the generator
# This file must contain the following:

# level1:
#   price: <The price of base generator>
#   item: <The name of the Minecraft material to produce>
#   time: <The time it takes to produce the material in seconds>

# To add more than the base upgrade, copy and paste the level1 definition
# Simply change it to say "level2", "level3", "level4", and so on
# Do not skip numbers, and do not start at 0
# Change the price, item, and time tags to the value you wish
# For a list of items, see https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Ensure the item is listed EXACTLY as shown on the above website

# Finally, make sure that each level has the price, item, and time tags defined
# Otherwise, your generator will not work, and will error to the Console
# Have fun!
